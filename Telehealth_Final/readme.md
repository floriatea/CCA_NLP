## Question:

This project seeks to explore the question: How has the integration of telemedicine and telehealth influenced the diagnosis and treatment outcomes for patients with various diseases in the United States vs. everywhere else around the world, particularly in underserved areas? It aims to understand the changing landscape of healthcare delivery through the lens of telehealth, identifying its impacts on accessibility, effectiveness, and patient satisfaction across diverse populations and geographic locations.

### Data:

The data for this analysis will be drawn from the News on the Web (NOW) corpus, which contains over 18.5 billion words from web-based newspapers and magazines spanning from 2017 to 2023. The corpus used is a subset of NOW that contains either the word "telehealth" or "telemedicine". It offers a rich, diverse, and contemporary collection of texts that reflect public discourse and media coverage on telehealth, providing insights into perceptions, experiences, and outcomes associated with telemedicine practices across the United States.

### Methods Plan:

Three primary methods will be employed: (1) content analysis to identify and categorize themes related to telehealth in healthcare delivery, (2) sentiment analysis using natural language processing (NLP) tools to gauge public and patient sentiment towards telehealth services, and (3) trend analysis to examine changes over time in the discussion and implementation of telehealth, focusing on its perceived benefits and challenges. Together, these methods should provide a comprehensive understanding of telehealth's role and efficacy in modern healthcare, particularly for those in hard-to-reach areas.
