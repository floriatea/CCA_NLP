 The 30-year old actress posed for British artist Jonathan Yeo in July shortly before her due date letting him capture her in the later stages of her pregnancy  Jonathan whose previous work includes paintings of Dennis Hopper and Nicole Kidman described the portrait as a tribute to Sienna 's courage and self confidence and praised her for stripping off for the artwork  The half part was nude too but no need to show that here lol  He said I can think of many figures whose public currency in part revolves around their appearance who would prefer to hide themselves away for nine months  Sienna is usually so petite and a wonderful fashion clotheshorse and the fact she is transformed means it has all the more impact  Sienna who gave birth to her first child with actor Tom Sturridge daughter Marlowe in the same month first met the artist in Los Angeles California eight years ago and the pair have remained close she has sat for in his London studio and Jonathan thinks it is the most important artwork so far  He said This is the most powerful so far There is a nervousness about it I think it 's the anticipation of becoming a parent  His painting of Sienna will go on display from Thursday for three months as part of the I 've Got You Under My Skin
 Kalandia Checkpoint The First New Gate To Jerusalem in 466 Years  SCI Arc graduate Harris Silver has shared his experience passing through the Kalandia Checkpoint during his quest for an uncanny truth that would lead him to develop an architecture project in the city of Jerusalem  The Kalandia Checkpoint is an opening in what Israel calls The Security Fence and what Palestinians call The Apartheid Wall Regardless of what you call the separation infrastructure the checkpoint acts a modern gate to the city of Jerusalem  After experiencing Kalendia first hand I came away realizing that until I personally walked through the checkpoint I was ignorant of the mechanism and tactics employed to humiliate and dehumanize everyone who passes through it Which means I was not fully capable of participating in the Israeli Palestinian discourse  Continue reading for the full Op Ed  I travelled to Israel in June 2010 with 11 classmates as part of my graduate studies in architecture at SCI Arc Our architecture studio was set up teacher Eric Kahn to develop our own projects and he encouraged us to find one with an uncanny truth The only requirement was that it be in Jerusalem  Because we were working in an ancient city on sacred land entrenched in history and biblical reference I felt a need to comprehend the city beyond the traditional tools that architects use and developed my own methodology to understand Jerusalem 's urban condition  I drew what can be described as a Psychological Map the city as seen through the experience of residents interacting with it I was interested in what types of transportation residents used to move around the city where they lived what they thought about where they lived their sense of security the things they liked most and least about their city what they would say to the mayor if they were to meet with him Ten in depth interviews were conducted with a range of residents store owners and clerks a retired professor a journalist From their who had to deal with checkpoints coming into the city were profoundly more negative and pessimistic than those who did n't They were visibly tired and seemed frustrated beyond hope I became curious about the checkpoints from their responses and decided to visit so that I could observe what the people I interviewed were talking about I went to Kalandia checkpoint multiple times to conduct research in this specific urban condition with the goal of finding an architecture project with an uncanny truth  As an American Jew pre disposed to being sympathetic to Israel I went to Kalandia with the understanding that the checkpoint was a necessary security apparatus to protect residents of Jerusalem from terrorists attacks  After walking through the Kalandia checkpoint I came away with a different understanding The checkpoints can be understood as a circulation machine with the need for security and while the term checkpoint is militaristic their function is similar to an airport or border crossing Someone needs to evaluate your papers and evaluate you before allowing you to checkpoint at Kalandia works is something else entirely something totally foreign The experience of going through it remains beyond easy description or comprehension  The physical description is straightforward There are two basic buildings The first building functions as a waiting area before you allowed into Israel The second building is the procession into Israel The waiting area is approximately 72 x 48 There is a roof for shade cover and the walls are open like a cage allowing air to circulate At the far wall there are two bathrooms When I was there both were locked with big metal chains going through holes where the door knobs used to be From the looks of it it seemed that they had been like that for a while which is probably why the entire place smelled like urine Between the two bathrooms there was a small space that was filled with garbage giving the impression that there was not regular maintenance Towards the back wall there were 4 benches approximately 10 long for and two smaller ones Facing the front there were 3 circular water fountains Two of them were not working  On the other side of the wall there was a big box approximately 12 wide and 16 long that has 3 windows facing the waiting area Between the box and the waiting area there was another layer of metal caging CCTV cameras and speakers are attached to the outside of the box The box would randomly yell at people in the waiting area the volume unnecessarily jarringly loud  Waiting is a big part of the experience The first time I was at the checkpoint I was with 5 classmates and we were forced to wait approximately 45 minutes before we were allowed back into Israel after an evening in Ramallah This was late at night and the checkpoint was empty The only real purpose for the wait seemed to be a small punishment a way to discourage us from visiting the West Bank because nothing puts a damper on a nice evening smells like urine and has a box that yells at you During the day a similar tactic is used Wait times are unpredictable which means it 's impossible to keep to a professional schedule when you also have to negotiate checkpoints to get into Israel People often spend hours getting to Jerusalem when it should take minutes  You wait until the box yells that the gates are open then enter one of two metal cage like chutes that are 18 wide by 30 long this begins the process of getting to Jerusalem The chutes are half the minimum width required by architectural code for a passageway making the chutes more like something livestock would be required to walk through to be transferred from point A to point B than a human  At the end of the chute is a revolving door very much like a NYC subway exit door except it 's smaller and more constricting This revolving door is operated electronically and sometimes it would move smoothly Other times chutes from proceeding  Once you pass through the revolving door you enter you enter a wider space and choose one of three hallways only 1 was open on all my trips and have to pass through another electronically controlled revolving door The same tactic is used here to control the door however as this one is not a single file line more aggressive people move through the crowd to the front This felt like it could be dangerous Once you are past this you deal with the radiological part of your visit A comparatively simple walk through a metal detector where you put anything you are carrying with you through a scanner  You then turn and face the wall to your left the stomach of the monster turns out to be the first place you see its face It is the face you might see on a travel brochure to Israel a young Israeli soldier who received Kalandia duty as part of their mandatory army service Through a speaker system that was set once I.D by slipping it through a slot underneath the glass barrier Inside the box other young army soldiers are operating computers There were biometric readers that I assume people that move through the checkpoint regularly use  If you are approved for entry to Israel you walk down a long corridor One can assume that on both sides of you there are people watching you through one way glass When you get to the end you turn right and walk ano
