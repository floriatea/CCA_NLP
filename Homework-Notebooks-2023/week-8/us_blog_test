 Dallas Cowboys Need To Go Back To The Beginning  The Dallas Cowboys have to find some answers after the Chicago Bears debacle But they had the answers to open the season To salvage this year they need to recreate what they did against the New York Giants  The Dallas Cowboys face huge questions again this season After a thorough and demoralizing dismantling at the hands of the Chicago Bears Jason Garrett and company have two weeks to try and figure out how to right this ship Fortunately the Cowboys have a perfect plan to look back on One these coaches and players were involved in They know how to go out and play an excellent game against a high caliber opponent  It 's time to throw out the adjustments Go back get out all the plans and preparation the team put in for the opening game victory over the New York Giants and let 's see what they can do with that There is one fairly universal principle in life When something works and works very well keep doing it  The Giants while not a flawless team are still a very good one with a superior quarterback and a feared defensive front And the Cowboys beat them convincingly Since then they have only been convincing in not playing at all the way we expected after that huge performance  While there are certainly mistakes being made by many players there were also mistakes made in that first game such as the Jason Witten drops But the game plan worked superbly  So I am saying that the onus now is clearly on the shoulders of Jason Garrett Rob Ryan and the coaching staff It is time to get away from trying to scheme for the opponent It is time to look at what the players wearing the Star can do and find a way to let them do it  Unquestionably the best drive Dallas had in the Chicago game was the touchdown drive just before halftime team down the field effectively Maybe the team needs to work on using that more Quit with the long convoluted chess matches before the snap using up all the play clock and trying to get the defense to tip their hand Instead just go out and dictate the pace coming at the other team relentlessly and not letting them have time to make adjustments Romo is very good at reacting on the move and maybe the team needs to put him in a position where he does n't over think things  The team still needs to get DeMarco Murray back on track This is more difficult but again even without the one breakaway run against the Giants he was effective in that game Find the most productive plays for him get the offensive line firing out and see if he ca n't get some positive yardage And if not then go to the uptempo passing game to loosen things up Murray will be much more dangerous when Dallas is playing with way to make that happen  Defense is the same There was a remark made during the game on Monday that the base Dallas defense was handling the Chicago offense better than when the team went with blitzes and fancy packages Maybe this can also be used as an approach especially with Jay Ratliff Kenyon Coleman and Anthony Spencer expected to be back in the lineup and Gerald Sensabaugh having a couple of weeks to get fully up to speed Rob Ryan has an impressive array of talent now but they have to be used properly  Blitzing has not been noticeably effective for his team as I see it but the defensive line is playing well and DeMarcus Ware is still racking up sacks Focus on rushing four or five using the line and outside linebackers Let Spencer read and react protecting against the run and then coming if the pass develops Do n't force him or Ware into coverage that is why you have Sean Lee and Bruce Carter fast heat sensing missile linebackers Let them and the new secondary players handle the receivers and let the linemen and edge rushers take care of the quarterback  Above all do n't get too cute Work on basic plays on both sides of the line Execute execute execute Look at a couple of hidden things from the game The offensive line did have better pass protection much of the time with the biggest issue seeming to be some hugely disappointing breakdowns from Mackenzy Bernadeau And the team finally eliminated the penalty problems They had only two flags dropped on them They were getting some of the basics right  This loss instead was because of a huge steaming pile of mistakes Receivers cornerbacks linemen and the quarterback all made some bad errors some due to poor judgement others flaws in execution and probably both at times I ca n't be sure of course what was going on with the players but it seems likely that they need to simplify their not trying to do everything  If I were Garrett I would throw out all but about 25 passing plays and 20 running plays If one works pull it back out later in the game If one does n't get away from it If one breaks down due to execution have a little come to Jesus meeting on the bench and try it again later This team needs to get some confidence it itself and what it can do It is time to quit being cutesy and start being hard nosed Ryan needs less adjustment because he still has a pretty good defense that should be healthier in two weeks but I still would keep it a little simpler Pre snap movement is confusing to the offense but I think blitzing should be used very sparingly  That of course is all one fan 's opinion But something needs to change before heading to
 share this story  There is no doubt that the Oct. 7 presidential vote will be Hugo Chvez 's most difficult election to date The man who has dominated Venezuela 's politics for over a decade and has often expressed his will to rule for at least one more is suffering from voter fatigue and an uncertain health outlook after being diagnosed with cancer in mid-2011 He also faces and emboldened opposition and a contender who has managed to create a compelling campaign and policy platform Indeed the electoral outcome is so uncertain at present that Henrique Capriles the opposition candidate could find himself in the presidential seat in Miraflores by early next year But betting on such an outcome is risky for despite all his administration 's failures Chvez remains one of Venezuela 's and Latin America 's most astute political leaders in modern history and he will do everything he can to win the upcoming vote  A learning process  The Chvez years have been a rollercoaster ride for the opposition vision the opposition reached a low point in 2005 when it boycotted the legislative vote effectively granting Chvez complete control of Congress and of all organs of state However a gradual process of consolidation around an opposition alliance called the Mesa de la Unidad Democrtica MUD has led to a change of fortune with the opposition regaining significant voter support in the past few elections Another key development has been the appearance of a new generation of political leaders including Capriles which has broken the link with the country 's discredited traditional parties Indeed Capriles was only 27 when Chvez was elected for his first presidential term in 1998 too young to have been involved in the demagoguery and corruption that plagued Venezuela 's traditional parties in the 1990s and which Chvez has used with great effect to discredit his previous opponents  At the same time despite his relatively young age Capriles has gradually built up a record as a skilled public administrator in the past 13 years first as municipality of the capital Caracas and until June 2012 as the governor of the state of Miranda one of the most populous in the country This has provided him with a solid base of support and political capital Capriles has also distinguished himself from past opposition candidates by building a policy platform that is more in tune with the social and economic concerns of lower income Venezuelans which make up the majority of the electorate One of his main campaign messages has been to reassure voters of the continuity of Chvez 's social programs promising improvements in terms of efficiency and management rather than a radical overhaul of social policy This has been a particularly sour point for the president who is unaccustomed to having opposition candidates appealing to his traditional support bases  As part of its campaign strategy the Capriles camp has also tried to focus on sending a conciliatory message to a very politically polarized society This contrasts with the divisive rhetoric of both Chvez and some of the more radical elements in the opposition primary elections in February this year where Capriles won by a very wide margin while the more extreme candidates obtained an insignificant share of the three million votes casted Now Capriles is trying hard to extend his message among disenchanted and chavista light voters who are tired of and uneasy with Chvez 's campaigning style which is heavily reliant on the fear factor and on discrediting his opponents  Still an uphill battle  Indeed it is this segment of independent voters composed of around 5 15 percent of the electorate who will tip the balance in favor of one of the two candidates Difficulties in discerning the preferences of independent voters have produced widely different results even in Venezuela 's more reliable opinion polls adding to the sense of electoral uncertainty that has been building up in the past few weeks This has been compounded by doubts over the intentions of other key voters particularly public sector workers who might fear some reprisal from the government for openly supporting the opposition Although the Capriles camp claims that this hidden vote of most polls is in fact that Chvez will win on Oct. 7  However surprising it might seem to some that Chvez is still leading in the polls after 14 years in power it would be very unwise to underestimate his electoral chances Yes Capriles has put together a remarkable campaign but no this does not guarantee him victory for Chvez has had at his disposal almost unlimited fiscal resources uninterrupted access to national media and the support of a well structured and loyal political base Moreover Chvez has an extraordinary ability to connect with Venezuelans to the extent that he is able to disassociate himself from some of his administration 's biggest shortcomings which would have augured the decline of any other administration As it stands now he still holds the upper hand  There is no doubt that the Oct. 7 presidential vote will be Hugo Chvez 's most difficult election to date The man who has dominated Venezuela 's politics for over a decade and has often expressed presidential vote will be Hugo Chvez 's most difficult election to date The man who has dominated Venezuela 's politics for over a decade and has often expressed  To make matters worse Chavez was weeping live on tv last saturday that he wants time to see his dream realized adding fire to the rumor that his health was getting worse Monday 's rally in Catia was abruptly cancelled The official line was that there was not much enthusiasm for the candidate strange but the next day another rally in portuguese was also cancelled without explanation Many are wondering if he is healthy enough to govern and if not who are they really voting for  Loading comments  Chavez will win by 20 points Capriles is the Venezuelan version of Enrique Pea Nieto a boyishly handsome puppet of the regime that was ousted at the end of the 20th century The difference is that Venezuelan voters are n't as gullible as Mexican voters nor can they be bought off with a 100 peso gift to put forth any workable position other than I 'm not Chavez That message works well to the crypto racist oligarchy that ca n't stand anything darker than a brown paper bag but it ca n't work in a country where most people are just that It most certainly is n't a winning strategy against a candidate who has a 60 approval rating So instead they 'll continue to sit in Miami and their mansions in East Caracas not understanding why only 30 of the electorate sees it their way  Despite the obvious conclusion of this upcoming election expect the opposition to start crying fraud before the vote counting even begins In fact they 've already begun  GarethJonesLives Chavez will win by 20 points Capriles is the Venezuelan  Loading comments  Loading comments  Capriles appears to be attracting massive crowds where ever he goes Also 2 newer polls give him a 3 to 5 point victory over Chavez The 20 point victory for Chavez was a few months ago It seems that Capriles support is growing while gov is slipping There is a lot of confusion out there and my Chavista friends are getting very aggressive not exactly a sign of confidence In the end votes will decide one way or another Speculation is a waste of time  observer501 Capriles
 Original content and news about the autism epidemic from the perspective that autism is treatable Anaylsis of current media treatment of autism and the environmental causes of autism  Folks I think Tony Bateson has a pretty good point here The USA might not like this but the place to do the vaccinated vs unvaccinated study is the UK Firstly because there are over two millions unvcaccinated since 1966  The Age of Autism Book  Meet Our Advertisers  Will Congressional Autism Hearings Be Different This Time  By Anne Dachel  On November 29th a congressional hearing will again address autism The simple truth is we ca n't afford to bring up the issue let lots of people talk and then go home with nothing resolved Something needs to be done about an affliction that is decimating our children and that officials seem unable to understand or to stop  4 Have you seen results from the government 's hundreds of millions of dollars in research spending  Please autism numbers have been steadily increasing over the last two decades to what can only be described as an epidemic rate while mainstream medicine and U.S. health officials have stood by helplessly unable to tell us the cause or the cure for autism There 's nothing a mainstream doctor can tell a new mother whose baby was born healthy and is developing normally that will ensure that this child wo n't also end up on the autism spectrum by age two On a daily basis we 're given news reports where experts solemnly tell us that all the autism is merely better diagnosing and an expanded definition of a disorder that 's always been around  In 2006 the Combating Autism Act was passed by Congress and signed into law by President George W. Bush This legislation authorized nearly a billion dollars over five years for screening education services and research The act created the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee chaired by Dr. Thomas Insel The act was reauthorized in 2011  Here 's what the advocacy group Autism Speaks The new law continues the federal government 's commitment to autism research services and treatment at current levels authorizing $ 693 million over the next three years The original act provided nearly $ 945 million over five years Since its passage in 2006 significant advances have been made in determining potential causes for autism as well as promising new early intervention behavioral treatments By signing CARA into law President Obama has ensured the federal government 's commitment to autism so that crucial research can continue unimpeded for the next three years  So how concerned is Congress about autism Besides the CAA what have they done to address a disorder that has claimed a million children in the U.S. How interested are they in the heated controversy over vaccines and autism  This is some of history of how the Congress has dealt with autism  In 2000 Representative Dan Burton held a six hour hearing on autism and childhood vaccines Burton talked about his grandson 's regression following his routine vaccinations Other legislators sounded equally development of autism Parents testified about the difficulties of raising an autistic child and about the link they saw between vaccines and their child 's autism There were calls for adequate studies to discern any causal relationship Dr. Andrew Wakefield was there presenting a report on his discovery of a new bowel disease he had observed in autistic children Dr. John O'Leary from Coombe Women 's Hospital in Dublin Ireland testified on the presence of measles virus in the children with autistic enterocolitis  Other well credentialed experts raised serious concerns about vaccines and autism and the failure of health officials to address vaccine safety thoroughly Wakefield had his critics at the hearing and representatives of the Centers for Disease and Prevention were there too attesting to the benefits and safety of their vaccines Dr. Paul Offit was in attendance and he criticized the committee for even holding the hearing because it could shake public confidence in vaccinations Offit was put on the defensive about his financial ties to Merck Other notables in the autism community included Dr. Bernard Rimland Numerous aspects clear twelve years ago that there were experts on both sides with strong arguments for each of their positions Back in 2000 the autism ratewas one in every 500 children  Dr. Insel testified that he still was n't sure if more kids actually have autism and he denied that vaccines were a factor Insel showed no interest when Harkin brought up the idea of a comparison study of vaccinated and unvaccinated children Insel was firm that the topic of vaccines and autism had been studied enough  Autism mom Dana Halverson testified about her daughter 's autism and the link to vaccines She spoke about the lack of oversight and the serious conflicts of interest among health officials and in their agencies  Then on August 3 2010 the Senate Subcommittee on Children 's Health held a hearing entitled State of Research on Potential Environmental Health Factors with Autism and Related Neurodevelopment Disorders I listened to the testimony and wrote this piece for Age of Autism  In 2010 it still seemed that lawmakers answers They had experts come to testify They talked about the cost of autism Environmental triggers were discussed We were told that there are around 80,000 possible untested chemicals that could be involved  Dr. Bruce P. Lanphear from Vancouver BC was most notable because he criticized the lack of oversight We know enough to require premarket testing To continue to experiment on our children is no longer tenable  Dr. Issac N. Pessah from UC Davis talked about a longitudinal study on expectant mothers who already had an autistic child and studying flame retardants as possible triggers  One senator asked Pessah what he 'd look at if there were no constraints Pessah 's answer Because of the complexity of autism spectrum disorders our lesson learned at UC Davis is that you need a multi disciplinary approach You need to have immunologists talk to neuroscientists talk to toxicologists and pool their efforts integrate their efforts in understanding this very complex disorder And so granted very large science will address more global issues valuable answers that could lead to mitigation of autism  Has any of this happened In 2010 the autism rate was one in every 110 children and today it 's one in every 88 kids  At the end of my story on the 2010 hearing I wrote this  What was disappointing was the lack of urgency in all this Lanphear made it sound like we could take years conducting research on autism The word mercury came up several times but I did n't hear about vaccines even once Autism seems destined to continue as the interminable mystery The environment may be at fault but with 80,000 possible triggers who knows when we 'll have any answers I wondered who set up the panel reporting to the health committee Why were n't there other experts and parents there Everyone had pretty much the same message We know it 's due to toxins but no one knows anything else for sure Where were the parents whose children were perfectly normal until they and after videos to highlight their accounts We could have also heard about the levels of toxins like mercury and aluminum found in these kids  Why did n't anyone ask why millions and millions of dollars have gone into genetic research when clearly the answers are n't there  Where were the DAN doctors Why did n't we hear about biomedical treatments and recovering autistic kids There could be some great before and after videos there too  Where were the expects who 've done the vaccine research Why were n't people from SAFEMINDS testifying  Why were n't we told that untested chemical additives are nothing new Deadly mercury is still allowed in vaccines and declared to be safe even though it was never tested or approved by the FDA  My biggest concern is over the tone of the hearing I 'd like to hear people call autism a health care emergency I 'd like it if they were going to call in more experts for more opinions on causation Why are we hearing about the kids who got sick that Dr. Bernadine Healy called for two years ago  Finally we 've officially declared autism to be an environmental disorder Beyond that there was little new in this hearing It 's seems we 're still happy to leave autism a mystery  One thing 's different today in 2012 we have the knowledge that while the federal government denies that there 's any evidence that vaccines cause autism a federal program created by Congress has compensated dozens of families of children for vaccine damage that included autism http 35;270;TOOLONG These findings were summed up in a report called Unanswered Questions Louis Conte father of triplets two of whom have autism was instrumental in this project He was interviewed on HDNet TV about the unanswered questions out there  I asked Louis about the upcoming hearing and about what he wants to see happen in Washington this time Here is his response  I can understand why Congressional hearings on autism would start with this and you have to start somewhere and then drill in  However make no mistake Congress needs to drill in  First of all the work that Brian Hooker has championed regarding the 2004 IOM decision through his FOIA requests really needs days of questioning by Congress There are thousands of documents to review and a number of individuals who need to explain their conduct in suppressing real science while facilitating the publication of research of dubious quality as in the case of Poul Thorsen  As many are aware I have been part of a team of people who have focused on the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program NVICP This focus lead to the peer reviewed publication of Unanswered Questions from the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program in the May 2011 Pace Journal of Environmental Law We found 83 cases of individuals compensated for vaccine injuries for brain damage and seizures that also included autism These were only the cases we could find and it is likely that there are hundreds more The Department provide this information We had to find the cases through available public records after an extensive investigation that took over two years  We ended Unanswered Questions with two requests The first request was that Congress hold hearings on the NVICP and second that there be an independent assessment of health outcomes of cases that the federal government has compensated for vaccine injury It is time to finally determine what a vaccine injury looks like  The existence of so many cases involving autism was never disclosed by HHS The Division of Vaccine Injury Compensation the Department of Justice Attorneys or the Office of the Special Masters to the 5000 petitioners in the Omnibus Autism Proceedings OAP Why not The entire program acted as though autism was a disorder that had landed in their program from outer space when in reality vaccine injury cases involved autism from day one The existence of autism as a result of vaccine injury is of enormous importance to the entire country and should never have been regarded as the this information from the public has had disastrous public health consequences and can be viewed as having allowed the autism epidemic to occur Further it also amounts to government sanctioned discrimination against the petitioners who used the word autism to describe their child 's vaccine injury  Congress has never held hearings on the NVICP The response of the federal government to autism is epitomized by the injustice that occurred and continues to occur in the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program If Congress really wants to know what the federal government is doing about autism they need look no further than at the program they created in 1986  It 's impossible to have an in depth discussion about autism without bringing up vaccines Twelve years ago vaccines and autism were the subjects of a six hour congressional hearing And then they adjourned There were more hearings but nothing was done  For their part officials have never waivered from their claim of no connection to the ever expanding vaccination schedule They 've produced study after vaccine industry On the other side independent research is piling up raising serious concerns about vaccine safety Both sides ca n't be right Either vaccines are culpable or they 're not In my opinion if this issue is to be resolved there has to be an independent comparison study done looking at fully vaccinated and never vaccinated children There is no excuse for not doing it There are thousands of unvaccinated kids to study If never vaccinated children have autism at the same rate as fully vaccinated ones this question would be answered once and for all  Among its highlights was Cong Waxman supporting p. 147 transparency I want to comment on the point that Mr. Burton made a minute or two ago about the fact that after some settlements people were told not to discuss their complaint I do n't know the facts of the case he cited but I do know that there are many many lawsuits for tort that are settled with the demand by the defendant that in kept quiet I think that 's wrong I do n't think facts ought to be kept quiet I do n't think they ought to be under seal After all to keep facts from getting out means that other people wo n't have the benefit of the information that could prevent the same thing happening over and over again to others Litigation may be a lawsuit between private parties but there is a broader public interest and we should n't allow the records to be sealed and information withheld when that information can benefit other people He also seems to support the Adminitration 's agreement to lengthen the statute of limitations which still has n't happened  GAO wrote a critical report on the program December 22 1999 http 35;307;TOOLONG Several bills have been introduced in Congress to e.g. reform the vacccine injury program Parents VICA require an independent Vaccine Safety Commission and fund an independent program of research on unvaccinated children None of these have had much support in part true extent of the collateral damage i.e. children injured in the ongoing war against infection much less truly have their backs  The QUESTION of whether vaccinnes cause autism has been ANSWERED yes The Government has paid hundreds of millions in judgment and settlements of vaccine cuased autism cases in Vaccine Court since at least 1991 But the true number of actual cases remains unknown because the Government has done everything to NOT compensate such claims from gutting the Table of Injuries to opposing scientific stays in Vaccine Court to blocking access to the Vaccine Safety Datalink to quickly dismissing the remaining cases in the Autism Omnibus Proceeding to hiding data and blocking research into the health status of unvaccinated children to directing the IOM NOT to review mercury science in its latest adverse events report all while still claiming there is no evidence that vaccine cause autism and that it is not known how much of the autism epidemic is real  Having watched as autism barely existed courts were removed and children went from a few vaccines to more than 70 with no vaccine liability while 1 in 6 children became Developmentally Disabled I am wondering why it is still not The shots heard round the world We need Action not 20 more years of studies  The USA might not like this but the place to do the vaccinated vs unvaccinated study is the UK Firstly because there are over two millions unvcaccinated since 1966 and my ad hoc researches reveal exactly none who are wholly unvaccinated and autistic Ten years of searching via personal contacts hundreds of letters four thousand replies to my one time website www.autismobserved radio broadcasts and letters published in multi million circulation national newspapers Secondly the UK maintains really good medical reporting vaccine uptake autistic diagnoses the answers are there just for the looking Thirdly they are generally the same vaccines as used in the USA supplied by the same producers I believe it will be done in the UK one 1SR  Dr. O I think most parents would agree that young children and even some infants are overexposed to electronic media However that is a very far cry from stating a link exists between electronic media and autism To make such a claim is irresponsible There 's no simply evidence for it No studies correlate autistic children with greater exposure to TV videos etc Such a correlation would be very easy to show if it existed  It is time to take Mom out the refrigerator and look carefully at the social experiences of babies and infants today in our very electronic world In the last 50 years our culture has rushed to embrace these alien elements into the lives of our babies without really considering the possible consequences  Babies are born looking for eyes faces and voices to bond with and to interact with Some babies and infants especially boys when given a choice seem to prefer the electronic variety to the human variety The catch is the electronic variety are decoys and ASD  The number of hours infants are in the presence of TV and video has skyrocketed along with incidence of ASD And do not forget the Amish who have largely been spared from this epidemic not only shun vaccines but they also shun TV 's and the like And yes I think there is a world of difference for the baby and infant between a talking Elmo and corn cob doll  The trouble with the vaccinated unvaccinated study is that I simply do n't trust our government to do it Data is manipulated so easily by the CDC when it comes to their sacred cow think Brick Township autism rates etc Even the 1:88 is a disgracefull statistic when you consider how outdated it is and the CDC 's exclusion of California from the group I 'd be willing to wager that Utah will be excluded next because their numbers scew the rate But I digress  We need a truly independent entity doing the research Know any billionaires who are n't in big Pharma I keep thinking but he 's pretty out there so who would believe it  My daughter 's IgE blood test is 300 reference range lt or = 114 She is also positive on the antinuclear antibodies test Her Measles Mumps and Rubella titers are highly elevated though she had the vaccine 18 long years ago It is interesting and perfectly placed that you have the CDC positioned on your website  IgE antibodies are found in the lungs skin and mucous membranes They are associated mainly with allergic reactions when the immune system overreacts to environmental antigens such as pollen or pet dander and parasitic infections Why It 's Done  The IgE test is often performed as part of an initial screen for allergies Symptoms of allergies may include hives itchy eyes or nose sneezing nasal congestion tight throat and trouble breathing Symptoms may be seasonal as with allergies due to pollen or molds or year round as with food allergies They can range from allergy  IgE levels may also be elevated in children with parasitic infections  To No vac This is a bit off topic but I will respond to your comments on HRT No one has been able to explain to me WHY the study of HRT was apparently done only on the method of HRT which gives Progesterone every day of the month The other method which gives estrogen half month and estrogen and progesterone half month and then both are stopped- was apparently not studied This truly baffles me I have taken the second method for 20 years and I m 65 and I m not stopping I have no health problem of the ones you mentioned and have an angiogram and some ultrasounds to attest to that When I got an incredibly painful arthritis of the hip after playing tennis a few years ago that healed on its own When they could make so much money why do nt they study the second method of HRT Am I missing something Just curious  These Oh my Bernie Rimland just rolled over in his grave Sorry doc but the only TV and electronic toys my son encountered in his first years were the ones in the pediatrician 's waiting room where we patiently awaited our turn to get him vaccinated into autism  The only reassuring thing about your comment is that clearly there is in fact a functioning time machine somewhere out there since you seem to have landed back in the 1950s And when I find that time machine I 'm going back twenty years to just before I had my children And this time around you can bet your life I wo n't be vaccinating them  Like most of you I want to know what is causing Autism so that future generations of children can be saved For now however the fact is that the millions of the dollars the government is spending could be funneled into treatment centers that would be accessible to parents wanting to help their kids NOW for us there is no tomorrow another 5 10 or 20 years for answers By then our children will be adults Adults without independent lives adults that will require round the clock care training and housing At the rate the budgets are being cut for support of developmental disabilities our children will be lucky if they can get a meal the likelihood of them being able to count on government support is unlikely without serious increase in funding and at a higher cost to tax payers  Is congress going to consider where the 1 in 88 kids are going to live work or be housed The upcoming numbers of people needing support are staggering We are caring loving parents who advocate for our kids but we are not going to live forever and with the stress some of us live with today some of us will have our lives shortened significantly Retire forget it  I want an answer honestly I do but right now I am sick to death of the 10,000 feet up government offices and in the media without anything being done for those of us here now fighting on the ground with our kids trying with every dollar we have every ounce of passion and love to just help our kids to make some difference in their lives Our kids are sick TODAY Five years from now is too late too damn late Shame on the officials and medical professionals that have sat back and let so much money be spent on so much wasteful research Old Dads fat moms REALLY If congress does not spend at least some time reviewing and questioning the decisions of the IACC and any other groups receiving funding on the funneling of this money to wasteful research then any proceedings from here on are just another waste of our precious time  Dr. O = that 's just another version of the Refrigerator mother theory something prevented our babies from bonding with us I disagree and take offense We all held and loved our babies we likely held them and interacted MORE than previous generations when A wealthy Mothers only saw their babies a few moments a day while nannies tended to the nursery or B Women had to work to find and prepare food and spent less time doting on their children A corn cob doll is hardly different from the talking Tubsy doll I had as a tot in the late 60s or the Tickle me Elmo my now almost 18 year had as a toy  There can be little argument that environmental factors have contributed to the explosion of Autism and ASD in the last 50 years but I doubt vaccines are the culprits Likewise all the genetic expertise in the world has not changed the lives of the thousands of families touched by this pervasive disorder The environmental culprit in my opinion is unlikely to be some exotic chemical the fetus is exposed in utero It is much simpler than that  There is a toxin causing ASD and Autism that is so prevalent in the lives of babies and infants today part of virtually every household around the world And 50 years ago it was non existent  The toxin is not ingested or passed through the skin but enters the brain directed through the eyes and ears of babies and infants  This toxin mimics the faces eyes voices and movements of living people and deceives vulnerable infants into bonding with objects that are social dead ends These objects lead the babies away from social interactions with their caretakers By the end of the first year of life the infants are mired in internal self communication setting the stage for ASD and autism  Jake you are right and smart parents do n't vaccinate anymore but to change the vaccination policy which is necessary a big govt sponsored study needs to be done Without it the CDC will always cite the fraudulent Danish and similar studies which still deny vaccine autism link  In my opinion if this issue is to be resolved there has to be an independent comparison study done looking at fully on the merits of doing such a study but frankly this debate has already been resolved Even the vaccine industry 's own shoddy epidemiology including that by indicted fraudster Poul Thorsen has connected vaccines to autism  The study comparing vac unvac children must be done without a delay It would have the same huge impact as Women 's Health Initiative study WHI initiated when Dr. Bernardine Healey was the NIH director That study showed conclusively that HRT hormone therapy in postmenopausal women induces all kinds of reproductive system cancers strokes heart attacks thrombosis early deaths etc Before that study it was assumed by most doctors due to pharma propaganda that giving reproductive hormones to aging women is healthy and a fountain of youth It turned out to be a path to early death  After the WHI study millions of women stopped taking hormones hence the breast cancer rate in the US dramatically decreased Pharma lost billions on sales of HRT pills The result of vac unvac study will reason why the pharma and their FDA CDC cronies are aggressively fighting it  Government policy is not set by legislators but by the bureaucracies they have set up to implement them Those folks are the foxes who raided the chicken coop and the chances they will ever fess up and do something about the disaster they have helped create are infinitesimal You 're on your own  I agree that a large scale vax unvax study must be done under federal auspices to insure credibility Dr. Robert Sears The Vaccine Book The Autism Book says that all that would be necessary would be to have the examining doctors blinded not knowing the vaccination status of the children they examined The parents of course would have made that decision The vaccine spokesmen at Shot of Prevention say that this would not be a scientifically valid study that the children must be vaccinated at random and not even their parents know what vaccines they had received This of course is nonsense a way to ensure it is presumably the line the industry would take to block the study If the parents knew the child was or not vaccinated for pertussis but the examining doctor did not and the doctor diagnosed asthma or failed to do so would this not be a reliable statistic to add to the data base Why would it not be scientifically valid unless the parents were blinded too Could the parents produce autoimmune disease or brain damage just by their knowledge of vaccines received Or is this just another smoke screen like Dr. Proffit 's saying no such study could ever be ethically done because it would deny the unvaccinated children of valuable disease protection  Speaking as a former goverment employee I do not have high hopes for what the federal goverment can do They can regulate and watch vaccines closer But what they can do for the cases already out there People are looking to cut funding for programs that serve people on the spectrum Cut them not add more revenue so we can been fighting to keep what little funding these programs have so they can continue Other programs such as those that have to do with alternative treatment is n't even brought up unless of course I do it and I do And I get the deer in the head lights look every time if not the downright condscending ones Even if I can proove with my own life what supplements and teas and other things can do Ginko Bilaboa has been a life changer Sorry to be cynical but it is what it is We are fighting an uphill battle But that 's alright up with the barricades Maybe if we bust their doors down with evidence they will buy a clue  Anne it is truly depressing to be read the 2006 Combat Autism Act CAA authorized nearly a BILLION dollars to be spent over five years and the 2011 reauthorization of the CAA authorized ANOTHER 693 MILLION dollars  Simply throwing money at the problem absent any only wasteful it is plain stupid  In my opinion as a requirement for authorizing continuing funds to combat autism Congress must demand public health officials support pending federal legislation that seeks to fund an independent scientific study of vaccinated v. unvaccinated populations to ascertain once and for all if BOTH populations have suffered the same inexplicable dramatic increase in chronic autoimmune disorders that have become the new normal for a child born in the United States  Make no mistake about it the CDC has the data expertise and resources to conduct such a study they lack only the will to do so Indeed if vaccines are as safe as the CDC claims them to be it would be in their own best interest to conduct the study and PROVE IT  If cutting off funds is required to strenghten
 @youthmaster  Twitter Updates  Saturday October 20 2012  When one looks upon Church History the fact that the early church was persecuted misunderstood and reviled can be easily seen From the very beginning this movement was doomed to be despised because it was so completely other foreign and strange to all it surrounded To the Jew it was an abhorrent religion that claimed the Old Testament justified worship of Jesus who in there opinion was just a man and unworthy of worship He as a person was so abhorrent to the Jews that they killed him as they would continue to do to the followers of Jesus  To the Romans the Church was a weird sect of Judaism that crept in and did unto their thinking weird things The Lord 's Supper was confused with cannibalism and the Love feast was confused with a massive orgy So whether Jew or Gentile the Church was awkward spacey and something feared by those it 's beliefs No wonder it was persecuted  To fully understand the totality of what was going on Shelley in his book Church History in Plain Language discusses in depth many of the issues that caused the depth of persecution the Church received  The Christian therefore is a person who is fundamentally different Men always view with suspicion people who are different Conformity not distinctiveness is the way to a trouble free life So the more early Christians took their faith seriously the more they were in danger of crowd reaction Thus simply by living according to the teachings of Jesus the Christian was a constant unspoken condemnation of the pagan way of life It was not that the Christian went about criticizing and condemning and disapproving nor was he consciously self- righteous and superior It was simply that the Christian ethic was a criticism of pagan life Shelley 2008 pg 39  I know that is a lengthy quote but I desire to upon the persecution of the church in the early days and do a little bit of social commentary of today The main thrust of this quote by Shelley is the complete otherness that the church declared through the way in which they lived their lives They received the scorn hatred and persecution they did because they were just different alien and foreign and this way of living confused disrupted and angered many  Conformity is the way many survive thinking if they do n't stand out if they do n't stick up higher than any others they wo n't get shot they wo n't get cut down Culture drives many to conform where they could otherwise shine or outshine all the others yet fear of man keeps many in hiding These Christians were so transformed by Jesus so affected by His message that they could n't be the same as they were and they could n't conform to world around them  One important distinction Shelley made was condemning and disapproving nor was he consciously self- righteous and superior Shelley 2008 pg 39 Too often I think we look at the lives of the early church and see that they were persecuted for their faith we think they were loud obnoxious and condemning of the world around them and as Shelley points out this simply was n't true of the early church They lived loved spoke acted reacted and walked differently but they did n't walk around self righteous pointing out the horrible sins of the world they were in  This distinctive I think can give young believers like myself hope because we 've seen a lot of self righteous Christians getting hammered by the culture and hear they the self righteous Christian claiming this as persecution for Jesus while we the young believer look on not feeling like the persecution as for Jesus so much as for being a jerk I think this living out the difference of Jesus had a but also the widespread embrace of the Gospel  When talking about the spread of the Gospel and why it was so effective Shelley says The practical expression of Christian love was probably among the most powerful causes of Christian success Tertullian tells us the pagans remarked See how these Christians love one another Shelley 2008 pg 35 Which fits perfectly with what Jesus said about the spread of Gospel By this all people will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another John 13:35 ESV This also correlates well with what Sittser said He says about Christians loving one another It the Christian Movement was providing a sense of belonging that was not readily available though traditional Roman institutions thus earning a reputation that reflected what the New Testament teaches about true community Sittser 2007 pg 52 This idea of loving one another was the essence of Christian community like  When I see the History of the Church both in historians books and the Scriptures and I come across a theme as deep as this unity in the Body and love for one another I always evaluate our current situation as a church As I stated in one of my responses to a fellow classmate I do n't think we are very loving towards one another and surely not in the same way or depth that the early church To see the depth of their love and unity is truly astounding and makes one admit it is only through the power of the Spirit that such love and unity could 've existed I fear we 've lost the desire to be so unified and loving towards one another and in effect have inoculated the world to Jesus  My social commentary on now may not be totally in line with the statutes of this paper but I feel compelled to make sure I 'm not only reading the material but attempting to apply it to my here and now in my mind a simple exercise of memory of the events that transpired but should cause any Christian to look at it and ask what can I do to be more like the beginning or what can I learn from those who were so utterly close to my Savior My personal goal in reading and study is to always seek to apply what I read  Also Shelley gives great insight on the largest cause of Christian persecution at the hands of the Romans which was the tradition of emperor worship Shelley 2008 pg 43 Christians simply refused to worship Caesar as a god and because of this refusal they received the wrath of Rome herself The allegiance of the Christians was to Christ and Christ alone they did n't desire to give a foothold to anyone or anything else So powerful this is because when looking at the converts many of them were former pagans and gentiles who were into all allegiance to Christ Sittser in his book points to the fact that all who want to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted 2 Timothy 3:12 and reminds his reader that the persecution of the church was due to their unfailing unwavering allegiance to Christ  I can imagine how this complete turn of strong dedication to a cause would make Rome fear this group whom even death was n't strong enough to force them to recant or reject Jesus How could a religion make former pagans so deeply ensconced with Jesus to the point of death So out of fear Rome struck hard at the Christians and for centuries these believers suffered wrongful death after wrongful death  One such story came from Sittser 's book the story of Perpetua Sittser 2007 pgs 37 40 Her story caused me to question my own faith and challenged me on if I would do the same as she did She had recently given birth and had a family that was the Jesus she recently accepted and all would be well with her again in life Her baby would survive her parents would take care of any and all her financial needs yet she refused to renounce the Jesus who saved her soul She went into the arena where gladiators would charge her and animals could tear her apart which would essentially sign the death sentence to herself and her newly born child Sittser says of Perpetua  Yet Perpetua refused to yield even to the pleas of her father the cries of her baby ad the scorn of the crowds Or the sake of Christ she happily submitted to death She made a decision not between life and death but between Christ and Rome Sittser 2008 pg 39  Stories like this cause me to ponder the depth of my dedication to Christ and his cause Thinking of allowing my child to die for a decision I was making is extremely hard to bear thankfully in my life I may in the history of the church did have to make it and they chose Jesus How deep is the mainline Christians faith today As I look out into Christendom I think the place we are the weakest is America where it is easier to be a Christian than most places and when it gets a bit tougher the collective moans and groans I fear the churches ease and comfort has also been much of it 's downfall in the US and Europe  The past is prologue when it comes to the decline of the church in the West Europe embraced Christendom as it 's main religion and in so doing many people were turned away from Christ because the Christ which was portrayed was skewed and in a lot of ways man serving I think we are seeing much of the same in America where many are disenchanted with the real Christ because there has been a fake Christ lurking about one that ca n't garner the support or passion the true Jesus commands  My of our faith because  we rejoice in our sufferings knowing that suffering produces endurance and endurance produces character and character produces hope and hope does not put us to shame because God 's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us Romans 5:3 5 ESV  I think we lose track of our real hope when life is too easy The early church clung to Christ knowing he was everything I fear we 've lost that a bit  About  I am a Follower of Jesus
