        "# Week 7 - Prediction & Causal Inference\n",
        "\n",
        "Last week, we explored (supervised) text classification, where we train a model to learn associations between text and some classification or value connected with it (e.g., what distinguishes a winning argument before the Supreme Court; can we extend our judgment regarding what documents are relevant to my thesis project to all of Google News; etc.) Classification often uses a representative sample of text about which we want to make inferences and then we use machine learning to learn \"true\" assignments and classify the rest.\n",
        "\n",
        "This week, we explore two different types of inferences to out-of-sample populations. _Prediction_ involves our reasoned expectation regarding an unobserved state of the world, given the world in which we live and on which we have trained our prediction algorithm. Often this prediction is about the future world. We don't expect the U.S. Congress to talk about the identical things today and tomorrow, but today should contain some useful information. by contrast _causal inference_ poses the related by distinct challenge of our reasoned expectations regarding an unobserved state of the world IF we intervene in some way. In other words, what does the intervention cause, and how can we predict it to change the world. Causality has a deeply contested history in social science and philosophy, but it usually involves an \"if,\" a difference between two counterfactual worlds, one where an event occurs and one where it doesn't.\n",
        "\n",
        "Causal questions in text analysis may place the text in one or more of many positions we explore below: as cause, effect, confounder, mediator (or moderator), or collider. For example, assuming that everything spoken can be transcribed into text, saying something mean might hurt someone's feelings (text as cause). Doing something mean might cause someone to say something angry (text as effect). Apologizing might change the influence of doing something mean (text as mediator/moderator). A compliment might obscure the effect of doing something mean (text as confounder). And yelling something audaciously mean might yield a loud, emotional response, which both influence the likelihood that the interaction was recorded and subjected to analysis (text as collider). As you can see, in a single conversation, text can play all of these roles. Why do we care about cause and effect with text? Because while words appear to exert power in the world, which words spoken under what circumstances by whom? Causal analysis attempts to get at the question, if _X_ was written or spoken, _Y_ would happen."

On the other hand, if you have new information, such as a trend beginning in December 2022 for spam emails to have \"Urgent:\" in the subject line, your 2023 prediction may differ by putting more weight on that indicator relative to others.\n",

Firstly, content analysis would be used to categorize texts within the NOW corpus based on themes related to data security, privacy concerns, mental health, and chronic condition management in the context of telehealth. This sets a baseline for the current state of discourse. Then, employing machine learning classification models trained on these categorized texts, we can predict the classification of unseen 2024 texts, assessing whether there's an increase in the proportion of texts discussing patient privacy/data security and mental health/chronic conditions in telehealth. Regression analysis could further quantify the extent of change in these themes over time, identifying significant trends. Feature selection in this model would focus on textual features such as specific terminology related to privacy concerns (e.g., \"data breach,\" \"encryption\",\"privacy\") and mental health/chronic conditions services (e.g., \"teletherapy,\" \"remote monitoring\"), alongside metadata like publication date and source type. This design leverages the temporal dimension of the corpus to forecast shifts in the discourse, providing insights into evolving priorities and practices in telehealth."

There are five types of variables that could be directly involved in our causal model, and any could be a text variable. This figure from [Keith et al. 2020](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.474.pdf) concisely shows the five positions for variables in acyclic (i.e., no arrows flow back into themselves) causal inference: treatment, mediator, outcome, confounder, and collider.\n",

        "Whether we're interested in text as treatment, mediator, outcome, or confounder, we have at our disposal the same causal inference strategies used with other forms of data, such as matching, difference in difference, regression discontinuity, and instrumental variables. Each of these methods usually gives you a more precise conditional identification of the causal influence than regressing an effect on a singular (purported) cause. For example, one of the readings for this week, [Saha 2019](https://doi.org/10.1145/3292522.3326032), uses propensity score matching, which is a straightforward method that works on most datasets (see Professor Gary King on [coarsened exact matching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvMyjDi4dyg)). For this assignment, we do not detail each of these causal strategies, but note several courses at UChicago that introduce these methods, as well as online textbooks (e.g., Scott Cunningham's [Causal Inference: The Mixtape](https://mixtape.scunning.com/)).\n",

        "You can do causal inference on any sort of text data as long as you have a plausible _identification_ strategy, meaning an argument that you can correctly identify a causal effect if one exists using your data and analysis. For example, if you have a data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) where you intervene randomly with some treatment, you can identify a causal effect with relative ease. Text exhibits a wide array of dependencies making unconditional randomization impossible, but we will attempt strategies that approach it."

        "Now we have 1,346 triples of quote-response1-response2, several text variables of response1 (e.g., \"Is the respondent using sarcasm?\") that may predict the agreement of response2. In other words: _Does a sarcastic comment lead to more agreement?_ Of course, as with almost all observational data, there are a number of confounders that make our identification difficult, but for now, let's explore how to run a simple regression in Python of agreement_r2 (dependent variable, commonly known as Y) on sarcasm_r1. Fortunately, we do have a strong case for identifying the direction of causality: Because response1 comes before response2, we can rule out the possibility that response2 affects response1."

Overall, our finding of significant effects for attack_r1/nasty_r1 and sarcasm_r1 persists with these new controls! This sort of robustness or sensitivity analysis is important for making sure your finding is compelling to yourself and to your audience. Consider doing other robustness checks, such as standardizing these variables before running the regression or adding [robust standard errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteroscedasticity-consistent_standard_errors). (To be clear, the analysis above would likely not be sufficient as proof of a causal effect for a peer-reviewed journal; you would likely need a more conditional approach using matching, instruments or differences in differences.)"

        "<font color=\"red\">Propose a simple causal model in your data, or a different causal model in the annotated Internet Arguments Corpus (e.g., a different treatment, a different outcome), and test it using a linear or logistic regression model. If you are using social media data for your final project, we encourage you to classify or annotate a sample of that data (either compuationally or with human annotators) and examine the effect of texts on replies to that text (e.g., Reddit posts on Reddit comments, Tweets on Twitter replies, YouTube video transcripts on YouTube comments or ratings). You do not need to make a graph of the causal model, but please make it clear (e.g., \"X affects Y, and C affects both X and Y.\").\n",

We will explore this further in Week 8 on Text Generation and Conversation.\n",

        "<font color=\"red\">***Stretch*** (not required): Propose a more robust identification strategy using either matching, difference in difference, regression discontinuity, or an instrumental variable. Each of these methods usually gives you a more precise identification of the causal effect than a unconditional regression. Scott Cunningham's [Causal Inference: The Mixtape](https://mixtape.scunning.com/) is a free textbook on these topics, and all have good YouTube video explanations."

This can be later operationalized by creating binary or categorical variables indicating the presence or absence of these keywords.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Sentiment Analysis and Engagement Metrics**: Apply automated sentiment analysis using transformer to assess the sentiment of text. For engagement, maybe count the number of words of an article(not ideal). Both measures can be automatically extracted from the data, leveraging the '#words', 'date', 'tokenized_text', and 'normalized_tokens' columns for detailed analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Regression Analysis**: Implement a logistic regression model as the outcome variable is binary (positive vs. negative sentiment). The model will test the influence of telehealth discussions' focus (benefits vs. challenges) on public sentiment or engagement, controlling for potential confounders like the publication date or country.\n",

By leveraging automated classification and sentiment analysis, we can efficiently process large volumes of text to identify patterns and causal relationships. "

        "- The Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach here aims to estimate the causal effect of a treatment on an outcome by comparing the before-and-after differences in outcomes between a treated group and a control group. In this context, the outcome variable is `sentiment_score`, and this is to investigate the effect of some \"treatment\" over time (before and after the treatment).e coefficient of the interaction term (`treatment_period`) represents the DiD estimate, which is the average treatment effect of the intervention on the outcome variable. A significant coefficient suggests that the intervention had a statistically significant effect on the outcome.\n",

        "- **treatment (0.5229)**: Suggests that being in the treatment group is associated with an increase in the sentiment score by about 0.523 units, holding other variables constant. This effect is statistically significant (p = 0.016).\n",
        "- **period (-0.1506)**: Indicates that moving from the pre-treatment period to the post-treatment period is associated with a decrease in sentiment score by about 0.151 units, keeping other factors constant. This effect is statistically significant (p = 0.016).\n",
        "- **treatment_period (-0.1153)**: This is the DID estimator, representing the interaction between treatment and period. It suggests that the treatment's effect on the sentiment score from the pre-treatment to the post-treatment period decreased by about 0.115 units. However, this effect is not statistically significant (p = 0.609), indicating that we cannot confidently say there was a significant treatment effect over time compared to the control group.\n",

        "- **R-squared (0.035)**: Indicates that approximately 3.5% of the variability in sentiment scores is explained by the model. This suggests a relatively weak explanatory power.\n",
        "- **Adj. R-squared (0.033)**: Adjusted for the number of predictors, indicating that the model is not overfitting due to too many predictors.\n",
        "- **F-statistic (18.05)**: The overall significance of the regression model is good, with a Prob (F-statistic) of 1.66e-11, suggesting that the model is statistically significant at explaining some variability in sentiment scores.\n",

        "**Conclusion:**\n",
        "While the treatment variable alone seems to have a significant positive effect on sentiment scores, the DID estimator (`treatment_period`) does not show a significant effect of the treatment over time when comparing the treated and control groups. This could imply that the treatment's impact is not significantly different before and after its implementation, based on the available data. The model's explanatory power is relatively low, indicating that other factors not included in the model may influence sentiment scores.\n"

        "## Splitting training and test text\n",
        "Above, we used a number of external measures of text, meaning that the measures were developed without any influence from this dataset. For annotations, it was Mechanical Turk workers measuring the text. For length, that is a mathematical count of characters. For sentiment, it was from a BERT model not trained on the Internet Arguments Corpus.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is not always the case. Consider if we want to make a measure of the text based on topic modeling. We build an LDA topic model of these comments, then we select an appealingly relevant topic and measure what number of words from Topic 1 each comment uses. Can we put that measure in the regression? We could, but it would lead to a biased estimate of the true effect size because our measure is no longer external or exogenous. The measure and model are double-dipping from the same textual information. This is important to keep in mind for your final projects, and for a more thorough explanation and justification, you can read more about this in [Egami et al. 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.02163.pdf).\n",
        "\n",
        "One approach to this in the Internet Arguments Corpus would be to build measures with the `pairs` that were not also `triples`. Sometimes we have excess data like this that is similar enough to our regression data, which we can use without reducing our regression sample size. For example, you could abductively generate a keyword-count measure like \"argumentativeness\" or \"thoughtfulness\" from non-triple pairs that isn't already in the annotations, and then count the keywords in the triples. You could develop an LDA model or word embedding measurement on some of the data, and the use it to establish an inferential relationship on the rest of the data. This would avoid contamination."

        "2. Method 2: Using propensity scores in telehealth project aims to strengthen the causal inference about the effect of specific telehealth-related discussions (treatment) on public engagement or sentiment (outcome). Propensity score matching (PSM) helps to control for confounding variables that could affect both the likelihood of the treatment (e.g., discussing benefits vs. challenges of telehealth) and the outcome (public sentiment), thereby simulating a randomized controlled trial's conditions to some extent.\n",
        "\n",
        "* By matching, stratifying, or weighting based on propensity scores, we can balance observed covariates between treated and untreated groups, reducing selection bias due to these observed covariates.It allows me to compare units (e.g., articles, comments) that are similar in terms of their likelihood of being treated, making the comparison between treated and untreated groups more valid.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Instead of matching on multiple covariates simultaneously, which can be complex and computationally intensive, propensity scores reduce the problem to matching on a single score that summarizes all covariates.\n",

        "When using propensity scores, we typically don't \"split\" the data in the conventional sense of creating training and test datasets. Instead, we're identifying pairs or groups within data that are comparable in terms of their propensity to receive the treatment.\n",
        "\n",
        "The logic behind using propensity scores is to approximate an experimental design where the assignment to treatment is random. In observational studies like examining telehealth's impact using web-based news and magazine articles, the treatment assignment (whether an article focuses on benefits or challenges) is not random and is influenced by observed and unobserved factors. Propensity scores attempt to control for these observed factors, making the comparison between treatment and control groups more valid and the causal inference stronger."

By comparing tweets with the same URL by the same author but with varied wordings, the study aims to isolate the effect of wording from other factors like topic popularity and author influence. The research employs a novel dataset and methodology to quantitatively measure the impact of specific linguistic features on the likelihood of a tweet being retweeted.
